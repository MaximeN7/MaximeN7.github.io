            <p>Joran Marcy is a former ENAC student that works as a software

                While not an engineer, his career path in game development aligns with my plans for the future
                and the way he started as an independent is a source of motivation.

            <h4>Intership and temporary contract at Numix</h4>
            <p>During my second year in La Prépa des INP I realised a 6 weeks long intership in software development in the 
                Numix company that led to a temporary contract of 5 weeks to bring my projects to completion.</br>
                During those 3 months, I worked on an Augmented Reality project where I developed the security system
                for the devices used in the experience.</p>
